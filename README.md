# README

This is a (currently really) basic tool for Agile / SCRUM teams to
assign issues in the sprint to each team member according to their
estimated capacity.

It's written in Elm, and I love it!!!

## How to

```
npm install
gulp
```

You may now open your browser at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)!

## TODO

- CSS
- Input of issues
- Export of assignments
- Setup of team members capacity
- Give access to issue details
